## Overview
### Description
Lab1 in CS590
### Project Evaluation
- **Category:** Social Networking / Food
- **Mobile:** Allows users to post real time images of the food they are having at a specific restaurant. It stores the location of the image to work with proximity later on. It could also work for a desktop application but the main goal is to develop on mobiles for convenience and ease of use. 
- **Story:** Allows users to search for nearby restaurants and see pictures posted by other users that have already been at the location, with a star rating and comments. Gives the user a chance to Bookmark restaurants that they want to visit in the future. 
- **Market:** Individuals that enjoy trying out different food experiences or that want to share their findings with friends and other users. People looking for food related ideas. 
- **Habit:** The app could be used often by people that frequently dine out to find new restaurants. Another potential user are people that are traveling or moved recently to find good food spots. 
- **Scope:** For now, we would like to focus on a feed with other user's posts, basic user/restaurant profiles and a bookmark page. In the future Foodie could scale to "following" other users, allow users to create different pages on their own bookmark section, link to the restaurant's pages or provide reservation information, etc.
